# **Drive API requires OAuth2.0 for authentication. PyDrive makes your life much easier by handling complex authentication steps for you.**

# Go to APIs Console and make your own project.
Search for ‘Google Drive API’, select the entry, and click ‘Enable’.
Select ‘Credentials’ from the left menu, click ‘Create Credentials’, select ‘OAuth client ID’.
Now, the product name and consent screen need to be set -> click ‘Configure consent screen’ and follow the instructions. Once finished:
Select ‘Application type’ to be Web application.
Enter an appropriate name.
Input http://localhost:8080 for ‘Authorized JavaScript origins’.
Input http://localhost:8080/ for ‘Authorized redirect URIs’.
Click ‘Save’.
Click ‘Download JSON’ on the right side of Client ID to download client_secret_<really long ID>.json.
The downloaded file has all authentication information of your application. Rename the file to “client_secrets.json” and place it in your working directory.

Create quickstart.py file and copy and paste the following code.

from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth

gauth = GoogleAuth()
gauth.LocalWebserverAuth() # Creates local webserver and auto handles authentication.
Run this code with python quickstart.py and you will see a web browser asking you for authentication. Click Accept and you are done with authentication. For more details, take a look at documentation: OAuth made easy
